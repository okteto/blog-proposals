# **Introduction to Kubernetes Operators**

When we deploy our application on Kubernetes, we use a variety of Kubernetes objects such as role, ingress, service, deployment, config map, etc. As our application becomes more complicated and our requirements non-generic, it becomes challenging to manage it using native Kubernetes objects. You would often have to use manual intervention or some form of automation to compensate.

The good news is that you've Kubernetes Operators to help. It can handle all these tasks for you, making it easier than ever to deploy new applications on your Kubernetes cluster.

This article talks about Kubernetes Operators, why they are useful, how they work and the best practices in using them.

## **Prerequisites**

This article assumes that you're aware of the basics of Kubernetes. A basic knowledge of Kubernetes operators can be helpful but is not desirable.

## **What is Kubernetes?**

Kubernetes (commonly known as k8s) is an open-source, portable, extensible container orchestration platform that helps ensure your applications are always running and available while also managing the resources they need. You can use Kubernetes to automate container orchestration, deployment, scaling, and administration.

Kubernetes was designed for deploying and running containerized applications on a large scale. However, Kubernetes has a steep learning curve and significant time and effort for developers to get started. Kubernetes can be challenging to manage and operate without a good understanding of the system and its underlying components.

## **What are Kubernetes Operators?**

In Kubernetes, operators are application-specific controllers that extend the Kubernetes API and help you build, configure, deploy, automate, and manage the lifecycle of a Kubernetes application. They take advantage of custom resources to manage applications as well as their components. A Kubernetes application is one that leverages the Kubernetes API and executes on a Kubernetes cluster.

Kubernetes Operators make these operations seamless, consistent, repetitive, and scalable by removing complicated and challenging manual activities, minimizing errors, and enabling optimal application performance.

Built on top of the fundamental Kubernetes concepts namely, resource and controller, it incorporates domain or application-specific knowledge to automate the complete life cycle of the application it manages.

Kubernetes Operators can standardize and simplify complex processes making them consistent, repeatable, and scalable, hence eliminating the need of time-consuming manual tasks and errors.

A Kubernetes Operator is capable of:

-   Installing applications with the necessary configurations

-   Scaling up or scaling down applications

-   Performing automatic backups

-   Initiating upgrades

-   Recovering from failures

-   Performing any additional administrative tasks that can be specified using
    code

## **Stateful and Stateless Applications**

Kubernetes is adept at managing and scaling a wide variety of stateless applications such as web applications, APIs and so on without requiring any knowledge on how these applications work.

Kubernetes doesn't have the additional domain-specific understanding needed for managing and scaling stateful applications such as monitoring systems. Stateful applications are more complex, and they need custom management. Here’s where Kubernetes Operators comes in.

Kubernetes Operators are adept at managing and automating the lifetime of stateful applications. They can help in managing complex configuration details required for a stateful applications.

## **Why does Kubernetes need Operators?**

Kubernetes Operators are required to automate processes that are otherwise accomplished manually by IT operations. They can help ease the process of managing Kubernetes resources by automating lifecycle management and deployment of software assets. Operators are extensions to Kubernetes that leverage custom resources to manage a Kubernetes application and its components.

An operator makes the application easier to manage so that you can focus on using the application without being concerned about managing it. An Operator oversees all that is needed to guarantee that the application runs seamlessly. Kubernetes operators are adept at backing data, recovering from failures, and automatically upgrading the application over time.

## **Kubernetes Operator Components**

A Kubernetes Operator comprises the following components:

**A Custom Resource (CR) -** A custom resource (CR), an extension of the Kubernetes API, allows us to declare our own complex types. In other words, a custom resource is a kind of object that extends the Kubernetes API or enables you to integrate your own API into a project or cluster.

A resource refers to an endpoint in Kubernetes that enables you to store any API objects of a particular kind. For example, Kubernetes' built-in pods include a collection of Pod objects.

**A Custom Resource Definition (CRD) -** A Custom Resource Definition (CRD) extends Kubernetes capabilities, enables you to create a custom resource, and makes it declarative using a custom controller. Like other Kubernetes resources, the CRD is defined in YAML.

The Kubernetes API server handles CRDs the same way it treats any other resource. It then reports the configuration content of a CRD to any authorized Kubernetes API consumer.

**A Controller -** A controller is a control loop that keeps an eye on the state of your cluster and makes or requests changes as needed. The controllers build control loops that constantly compare the intended state of a cluster to its actual state.

### **Reconciliation Loops**

In Kubernetes, a controller is a software loop also known as the “Reconcile loop”. A controller manager manages the Kubernetes cluster by running controllers in a reconciliation loop in the control plane. It executes a control loop that allows each controller to run by executing its Reconcile() function.

Each controller tries to get the present cluster state closer to the state that is desired. If the current state of the cluster does not correspond to the intended state, the controller takes appropriate action to correct the problem.

Figure 1: The Reconciliation Loop

Kubernetes Operators take advantage of an infinite loop that cycles through three stages, namely, "Observe," "Diff," and "Act".

- Observe - The first step is to observe the condition of your cluster.

- Diff - This compares the current state to the intended state.

- Act - Using application logic, the reconciliation function attempts to correlate the present state of resources with the intended state in this phase.


The control loop is the core to how Kubernetes works; it monitors the condition of your real cluster.

## **Operator Framework**

The Operator Framework in Kubernetes is an open-source toolkit that helps build and manage Kubernetes native applications, better known as Kubernetes Operators, in an automated, efficient, and scalable manner.

The Kubernetes Operator Framework is a set of tools and libraries to build new operators. It comes with a set of predefined operators for common operations, such as deployment, and gives you the ability to write your own from scratch.

You can leverage the Kubernetes Operator Framework to create an operator in a few lines of code. You need not have any deep understanding of the system or any programming experience. Operators have different levels of privileges which determine what they can do on the Kubernetes cluster.

The Operator Framework comprises:

-   Operator SDK: This is the core component of the Operator framework and helps launch an Operator project quickly. It allows developers to create operators based on their expertise without having to understand the intricacies of the Kubernetes API. The Operator SDK offers higher level APIs and abstraction thus saving developers time spent on drilling down into Kubernetes APIs. Instead, the developers can focus more on writing operational logic.
    
-   Operator Lifecycle Manager: Administers the installation, upgrades, and management of all operators operating in a Kubernetes cluster. Operator Lifecycle Manager is a tool that allows you to manage, update, and install all operators, as well their dependencies.
    
-   Operator Metering: Allows operators who offer specialized services to report usage. Operator metering captures historical usage data of a cluster and then generates usage statistics that breakdown consumption by pod or namespace over arbitrary periods of time.

## **How Does a Kubernetes Operator Work?**

In a Kubernetes cluster, an operator comprises a collection of one or more custom resources, as well as a control loop process, all of which are contained inside a pod and runs inside it.

When a user edits a custom resource, the operator application detects the change and takes appropriate action. These actions can often be calls to the Kubernetes API.

Figure 2: Kubernetes Operator at work!

Operators use controllers to monitor the behavior and actions of Kubernetes objects. These differ from regular controllers in that they track custom objects, also called custom resource definitions (CRDs).

The CRD is an extension of the Kubernetes API allowing you to store structured data representing the desired application state. Operators keep track of cluster events that relate to specific types or custom resources. An operator can monitor events that are added, updated, or deleted.

As soon as the operator observes changes in the environment, the custom controller takes measures to bring the cluster to the desired state. That is known as the "reconciliation loop".

Here's a summary of the workflow:

1.  A Custom Resource Definition (CRD) is modified by the user

2.  The operator monitors the CRD and detects changes

3.  The operator compares the current CRD state to the desired state

4.  Finally, the operator reconciles the cluster state to the desired state

## Steps to Build an Operator

You can build an Operator in several ways:

-   Operator SDK - this is a framework that contains helper functions to build operators in Ansible, Go, or HEML.
    
-   Kubebuilder - this represents a framework for building Kubernetes APIs

-   ClientGo - this can connect to the Kubernetes API, but the downside is that it has a steep learning curve.

## Deploy an Operator

You can deploy an Operator in the following ways:

-   Using Helm chart

-   Using Yaml as the Kubernetes manifest

## **Why Do We Need Custom Operators?**

There are several benefits to implementing your custom Operators:

-   Automate operational tasks that are often handled manually

-   Makes applications more Kubernetes-friendly

-   Assists in testing all scenarios

-   Human mistakes are eliminated

-   Reduces the complexity of application management in hybrid and multi-cloud environments

## **Best Practices for Writing Kubernetes Operators**

Here are some best practices you should follow if you're developing Kubernetes
Operators:

-   Build one Operator for each application

-   Use the Operator SDK

-   Use declarative APIs

-   Leverage asynchronous sync loops

-   Compartmentalize features by taking advantage of multiple controllers

-   You should edit one custom resource at a time

## **Conclusion**

Kubernetes Operators simplify complex and time-consuming manual tasks and make them uniform, repeatable, and scalable by removing complicated and tedious manual tasks. This reduces errors, improves application performance, and helps you avoid costly mistakes.

Kubernetes Operators are designed to make it easier for applications to manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes objects. They provide an API, logic, and control loops that call upon other Kubernetes API operations. The idea behind them is to encapsulate repeatable operations into a single logical construct, making deployment simpler and observability more straightforward.
